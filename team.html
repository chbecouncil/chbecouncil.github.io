                            position because we would like to continue to be a part of the CHBE executive council in the 2016/2017 school year. This year we had an amazing time as second year co-reps, as well as having learned a lot from working together, which has given us the experience to be a successful co-VP team. We are both highly organized and friendly individuals, and we love being active members in the CHBE Undergrad community, so running as a VP team would be a perfect fit for us.</p>

                        <hr>

                        <p>Next year we would like to 
                            continue some of the projects that the CHBE Undergraduate club has started/taken on, such as redesigning the club room, refurbishing CHBE merchandise, and in general, continuing to work with all of the undergrad students to build up the CHBE community through various events and activities. </p>

                        <p>As it is my last year in CHBE,
                            I'd like to get more involved in the activities of the council. The secretarial role also seems like a good way to support the different council activities, as I can sort of be like an all-around assistant to the council activities! I am a good fit for the position because I am very organized, can manage my time well and have great communication skills. These skills are contributing factors to my reliable work ethic, which usually results in getting things done. I also have a tendency to go above and beyond my duties, which can help the team become super aCHiBErs (achievers)!</p>

                        <hr>

 
                        <p>I hope to accomplish secretarial 
                            duties by taking concise and accurate meeting minutes, keeping the CHBE website up to date (if that is a secretarial role), keeping CHBE students aware of engineering and CHBE related events by getting the word out through the website or other media, aid in any promotional poster making for events, organize elections, and get involved in planning other CHBE activities as part of the council (like creating more outreach related events). Overall, I would like to do my responsibilities well and help council events run smoothly. </p>

                            a lot of CHBE spirit to share! As fourth year reps we want to make our last year great for us and all our fellow fourth years. This includes making our last academic year go by smoothly and as stress free as possible by listening to the student body and working closely with the academic reps; creating a magnificent grad package by getting everyone an iron ring and some snazzy grad photos they'll be proud to take home to the parents as well as some slipstick memories we can keep to ourselves; and of course some grad ragers. As publicity officers this past year, we got to learn about the structure of CHBE council and spend some time with the current fourth year reps, giving us the chance to see all the responsibilities and work involved with the position and we are well equipped to represent fourth year!</p>

                        <hr>

                        <p>Our main focus is to represent 
                            the fourth years and ensure their voices are heard. It's our last year and we shouldn't have to fret about formals and midterms falling in the same week or back to back midterms during E-week. We would also like to facilitate an easy transition to convocation, including iron ring sizing and grad photos. Being the creative publicity officers we are, we would love to create a fantastic CHBE spread for the slipstick. And last but not least we want to get the fourth years to remember their last year at UBC as one of the best! Grad dinners and parties, and if we can raise enough funds even a grad trip! </p>

                            My experience in the CHBE Undergraduate Club began as the Second Year Representative last year. Since entering CHBE, I have been involved with various CHBE sport teams, E-Week, and socials. <br><br>

                        </p>
                            Ask me about photography, baketball, or anything CHBE! 

                        <hr>

                        <p>Tony:"My goals for next year if I am elected are to
                            improve the academic support for the second year students, to improve the camaraderie and spirit within CHBE, and to organize the third year field trip. During the second term of my second year, we had CHBE 230 tutorial before the first quiz that was very successful with students. I want to expand on that idea to hosting more peer lead tutorials, and perhaps even develop a peer tutoring program in the department. Secondly I want to help increase the turnout of students during E-Week and at our socials by getting people more excited about our events. Lastly, I will ensure that the third year field gets organized properly and keep an active line of communication with students about any updates."<br><br>

                            Tyra:"My hope is that I can plan a successful 3rd Year Field Trip (I am currently on the council already) for September by working with the previous 3rd Year Reps. It is my goal to find at least one more example of biological industry to visit during the trip. Additionally, I want to accurately represent the views and opinions of the 3rd Year students in CHBE, as well as be able to bring to attention any potential issues that may arise throughout the year."</p>

                        Tyra: "There is the slight chance 
                            that I could be placed in a co-op term that is longer than the 4 months of summer. In the event of that scenario I would still want to be a part of the CHBE Undergraduate Council and participate as much as I am able, However, I understand if I must step down in favor of a candidate that is currently in classes."</p>

                            2. I have managed to accumulate a wide source of contacts I can tap into within and outside of UBC. Namely from past jobs, acquaintances, past networking events.<br>
                            3. I am a president candidate of EWB next year, and will probably be able to use the contacts there for this position.<br>
                            4. I am in the Biological Option, the reason why I wouldn't mind co-running with someone in the Process Option is to diversify interests. Someone may know oil companies better than I do (highly likely).<br>
