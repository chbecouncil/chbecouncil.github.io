                        <p>We are running for Co-President of the CHBE Undergraduate Club, because we want to make the CHBE undergraduate experience awesome for all students in our department. This is a position of great responsibility, and we believe we have what it takes to make a meaningful contribution in this position. Both of us have been part of the CHBE Undergraduate Club this year and we have plenty of idea to make sure next year is an even better year for CHBE students.</p>

                        <hr>

                        <h5>What do we expect to accomplish</h5>
                        <p>"We are, and have been heavily involved in the organization and operation of the club for the past year. We know the workings of the club, and we are also aware of the areas in which we can improve. </p>

                        <p>Mike: I proved my organizational capabilities and leadership qualities as one of the principal organizers of the 3rd year field trip of 2015.</p>

                        <p>JP:  This year, I have shown leadership and initiative in my roles in the club and I believe I am a well-rounded person based on the wide variety of projects I participated in over the last months."</p>

                        <p>Mike: My goals for the next year would be to improve the club’s merchandising, work on making CHBE more competitive during E-Week, and explore new ways in which the club can help students with academic and social lives.</p>

                        <p>JP: My goal for 2016-2017 would be to enhance CHBE spirit and sense of belonging, provide more ways to help students get ready for the world after graduation and increase CHBE undergraduate exposure to the industry.</p>

                        <h5>Why are we a good fit?</h5>
                        <p>We are running for Co-President of the CHBE Undergraduate Club, because we want to make the CHBE undergraduate experience awesome for all students in our department. This is a position of great responsibility, and we believe we have what it takes to make a meaningful contribution in this position. Both of us have been part of the CHBE Undergraduate Club this year and we have plenty of idea to make sure next year is an even better year for CHBE students.</p>

                        <hr>

                        <h5>What do we expect to accomplish</h5>
                        <p>"We are, and have been heavily involved in the organization and operation of the club for the past year. We know the workings of the club, and we are also aware of the areas in which we can improve. </p>

                        <p>Mike: I proved my organizational capabilities and leadership qualities as one of the principal organizers of the 3rd year field trip of 2015.</p>

                        <p>JP:  This year, I have shown leadership and initiative in my roles in the club and I believe I am a well-rounded person based on the wide variety of projects I participated in over the last months."</p>

                        <p>Mike: My goals for the next year would be to improve the club’s merchandising, work on making CHBE more competitive during E-Week, and explore new ways in which the club can help students with academic and social lives.</p>

                        <p>JP: My goal for 2016-2017 would be to enhance CHBE spirit and sense of belonging, provide more ways to help students get ready for the world after graduation and increase CHBE undergraduate exposure to the industry.</p>
