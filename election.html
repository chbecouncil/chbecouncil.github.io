                    <p>When my time is not consumed by design competitions/teams, meetings or engineering, I enjoy binge watching Grey’s Anatomy, re-reading Harry Potter and taking afternoon naps.
                    I enjoyed working as part of CHBE Council this past year as Co-Third Year Rep, and I’m excited to continue to build on the work that the council accomplished this year! </p>

                    <p>I’m a crazy morning person with a weird sarcastic sense of humour. I'm also super friendly and I love getting to know people. If you see me around CHBE don’t hesitate to say hi! (I was asked today if I lived in the clubroom, so that's where you'll probably find me). I think community is incredibly important for students to be successful, and I’ve had an amazing time being able to hold executive positions since I started in CHBE. I’d love to continue to improve CHBE to make it the best it can be!

                    <p>As execs on council we have gained relevant experience in event planning and providing support for all executive members. As a part of this involvement, we continue to work as liaisons between the CHBE Club, the students, and the department, in order to foster a positive CHBE community. This past year, we have worked closely in our involvement on council. We are both extremely committed and dedicated to both CHBE and CHBE Council and we have learned a lot working together, which makes us the best candidates for this position.</p>

                        We believe that we are a good fit for the vice president position because we love attending CHBE events, and want to become more involved in facilitating them in the coming school year. We are very present in our classes, and our co-vice presidency will span both third and fourth year courses, giving us an opportunity to connect with more of our CHBE peers. Our organizational skills will be valuable in managing communications within the council, as well as supporting the volunteer officers. We are excited to be involved in all the projects that the CHBE Undergrad club offers, and can’t wait to help make the CHBE Undergraduate Club the best that it can be.

                    <p>We love CHBE and all the students in the program. The events the council puts on are amazing and we would love to be involved in the planning of these events.

We're also very willing to help out with other projects the council may be working on.

Furthermore, we have both had experience working in teams through extracurricular activities and enjoy being able to collaborate with others.

                    <p> My name is Michael White and I am a third year chemical engineering student going into fourth year in September. I am currently involved with the Chem-E-Car design team and the UBC chess club. In my spare time I enjoy playing soccer and running. I want to be more involved in CHBE and the shared position of Academic Coordinator with Edward appeals to me because I have always found the Beef and Pizza sessions to be a unique and successful method of allowing students’ opinions to be heard. </p>

                    <p>Hello! My name is Edward Wen and I am in third year CHBE, going into fourth year in the fall. Currently, I am involved with Chem-E-Car and I enjoy running, painting, and eating in my spare time. We all know how stressful school can be. Although students may talk amongst each other regarding shared concerns, the problem is usually not brought to light. I hope to change this by being the Academic Coordinator co-rep with Michael, and creating a more accommodating, and productive learning environment in CHBE. 

                    </p>
                    </br>
                    

                    <b style = " font-size: 13pt;">Why are you a good fit for this position?</b></br>

                    <p>Edward and I are good friends whose skills complement each others nicely. This year we have worked together on the Chem-E-Car junior battery team, attending regular meeting and coming up with creative solutions to real world problems. <br>

                    I believe our combined experience as two fourth years, one in chemical engineering and one in chemical + biological engineering will allow us to relate well with the students who are currently going through the same courses as us, or courses that we have previously taken.<br>

                    I have prior experience emceeing assemblies in high school and would be confident leading the discussion at the Beef and Pizza sessions. <br>

                    Edward and I know how challenging this program can be and will try to implement new ideas to ease the academic stress that comes with a full course load. <br>

                    </p>

                        <li>More regular beef and pizza sessions. We would ideally like to run one before first midterms and one before second midterms in each semester.</li>
                        <li>We will have a box at the Beef and Pizza sessions where people can drop in anonymous suggestions on pieces of paper as we know it can be a bit intimidating to raise your opinion in front of your classmates, friends and professors.</li>
                        <li> Edward and I will have a 24 hour response policy where CHBE students can email or Facebook message us their academic concerns and we will respond suggesting a solution or meeting time to further discuss their problem within 24 hours. We wish for students to bring their academic concerns throughout the term, not just at the Beef and Pizza sessions. We will be able to help students resolve their queries or direct them to the right people that can help them.</li>
                        <li>Edward and I will also periodically send out anonymous surveys regarding courses in the CHBE Facebook groups to gauge student feedback during the times between the Beef and Pizza sessions. If any issues are raised (e.g. too many deadlines in one week) we will work with the year reps and the professors to see if a solution can be reached.</li>
                        <li>Presidential Candidates have mentioned an interest in encouraging more group work within CHBE, and we believe this is a great idea. Ideally we could have a system with peer-to-peer tutoring for students where anyone can have their questions answered by their friends. Edward and I will be working with the new council to see what can be achieved.</li>

Both of us have talked about methods that could improve our previous courses, and we are passionate to help new chemical engineering students learn in the most efficient way possible. We will engage with students at "beef and pizzas" to gain an understanding of how students are feeling about their courses, and relay this information to the professors. I believe Victor and I can improve the relationship between students and professors and create an efficient learning situation for students of all years.</p>
